# Polaris Python Assignments 🚀

This repository contains all of my assignments from the **Polaris Artificial Intelligence Program**.  
The program focuses on learning Python step by step through structured weekly projects that emphasize **problem-solving, clean logic, and real-world use cases**.

The main goal of this repository is to:
- document my learning progress,
- showcase my coding style and thinking process,
- and build a solid foundation for future **AI, ML, robotics, and engineering projects**.

## 📚 Assignments Overview

---

## 📌 Assignment #1 — Python Basics

**Focus:**  
Understanding how Python programs work from input to output and learning how to think algorithmically.

### Topics Covered
- Basic Python syntax  
- Variables  
- Conditionals  
- User input & output  
- Working with VS Code  
- Introduction to Git & GitHub  

### Mini-Projects

| File | Description |
|-----|------------|
| `hundred_years_calculator.py` | Asks the user’s name and age, then calculates the year they will turn 100. |
| `simple_calculator.py` | Performs basic arithmetic operations on two user-entered numbers. |
| `positive_negative.py` | Determines whether a number is positive, negative, or zero. |
| `grader.py` | Prints **Passed** or **Failed** based on the user’s exam score. |

## 📌 Assignment #2 — Loops, Data Structures & Libraries

**Focus:**  
Learning how to control program flow, repeat operations, handle errors, and use built-in libraries.

### Topics Covered
- Loops (`for`, `while`)  
- Nested loops  
- Error handling (`try-except`)  
- Python standard libraries (`random`, `datetime`)  
- Writing interactive CLI programs  

### Mini-Projects

| File | Description |
|-----|------------|
| `countdown.py` | Counts down from a user-defined number and finishes with **"Ateşle! 🚀"**. |
| `sum_calculator.py` | Calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to N. |
| `multiplecation_table.py` | Generates a multiplication table using nested loops. |
| `number_check.py` | Validates user input and prevents crashes caused by invalid input. |
| `guessing_game.py` | Random number guessing game with higher/lower hints. |
| `midterm_counter.py` | Calculates remaining time until the next exam using `datetime`. |

## 📌 Assignment #3 — Data Hunters (Files, Regex & Testing)

**Focus:**  
Working with **realistic, messy data** and making programs more reliable, reusable, and testable.

This assignment introduces three important engineering skills:
1. **Data persistence** (files do not disappear when the program closes)
2. **Data cleaning** using Regular Expressions
3. **Verification** using unit tests

### Topics Covered
- File I/O (reading from and writing to files)  
- Regular Expressions (Regex)  
- Data extraction and cleaning  
- Interactive CLI design using loops  
- Unit testing with `pytest`  

### Mini-Projects

| File | Description |
|-----|------------|
| `data_hunter.py` | Extracts emails and phone numbers from broken data using Regex. The user can choose between loading data from a file or pasting raw data manually. Cleaned results are saved to output files. |
| `password_security.py` | Interactive password validation system that checks for uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The program runs in a loop and provides clear feedback. |
| `test_security.py` | Unit tests written with `pytest` to verify the password validation logic under multiple scenarios. |
| `broken_data_level1.txt` | Noisy sample data containing mixed valid and invalid contact information. |
| `broken_data_level2.txt` | More complex broken data with duplicates and log-style entries for advanced cleaning. |
