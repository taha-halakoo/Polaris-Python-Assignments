Polaris Python Assignments 🚀

This repository contains all of my assignments from the Polaris Artificial Intelligence Program, where we learn Python fundamentals step by step through structured weekly projects.

The goal of this repository is to document my progress, showcase my work, and build a strong foundation for future AI, ML, robotics, and engineering projects.

📚 Assignments Overview
📌 Assignment #1 — Python Basics
Topics Covered:

Basic Python syntax

Variables

Conditionals

User input & output

Getting started with VS Code & Python

Introduction to GitHub

Mini-Projects Included:
File	Description
hundred_years_calculator.py	Asks the user’s name and age, then calculates the year they will turn 100.
simple_calculator.py	Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two user-entered numbers.
positive_negative.py	Checks whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero.
grader.py	Prints "Passed" or "Failed" based on the user’s exam score.
📌 Assignment #2 — Loops, Data Structures & Libraries
Topics Covered:

Loops (for / while)

Nested loops

Error handling (try-except)

Python standard libraries (random, datetime)

Project-based learning

Mini-Projects Included:
File	Description
countdown.py	Takes a number and counts down to zero, ending with "Ateşle! 🚀".
sum_calculator.py	Calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to N.
multiplecation_table.py	Generates a multiplication table from 1 to 9 using nested loops.
number_check.py	Validates user input and prevents crashes when invalid input is entered.
guessing_game.py	Random number guessing game with higher/lower hints.
midterm_counter.py	Calculates the remaining time until the user’s next exam using datetime.
📌 Assignment #3 — Data Hunters (Files, Regex & Testing)
Topics Covered:

File I/O (reading from and writing to files)

Regular Expressions (Regex) for data extraction

Data cleaning and validation

User interaction through CLI menus

Unit testing with pytest

Mini-Projects Included:
File	Description
data_hunter.py	Extracts emails and phone numbers from broken data using Regex. Allows the user to choose between reading from a file or pasting raw data manually. Results are saved into clean output files.
password_security.py	Interactive password validation system that checks for uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters using Regex. Continues running based on user choice.
test_security.py	Unit tests written with pytest to verify the password validation logic under different scenarios (valid, missing rules, invalid passwords).
broken_data_level1.txt	Sample noisy data file with mixed valid and invalid contact information.
broken_data_level2.txt	More complex broken data including duplicates, logs, and repeated entries for advanced cleaning.
