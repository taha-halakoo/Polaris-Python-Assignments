Polaris Python Assignments 🚀

This repository contains all of my assignments from the Polaris Artificial Intelligence Program, where we learn Python fundamentals step-by-step through structured weekly projects.

The goal of this repo is to document my progress, showcase my work, and build a foundation for future AI/ML projects.

📚 Assignments Overview
📌 Assignment #1 — Python Basics

Topics Covered:
Basic Syntax
Variables
Conditionals
Getting started with VS Code & Python
Introduction to GitHub

Mini-Projects Included:
hundred_years_calculator.py	Asks the user’s name & age, then calculates the year they will turn 100.

simple_calculator.py	Adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides two user-entered numbers.

positive_negative.py	Checks whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero.

grader.py	Prints "Passed" or "Failed" based on the user’s exam score.


📌 Assignment #2 — Loops, Data Structures & Libraries

Topics Covered:
Loops (for / while)
Nested loops
Error handling (try-except)
Python standard libraries (random, datetime)
Project-based learning
Mini-Projects Included:

File	Description
countdown.py	Takes a number and counts down to zero, ending with "Ateşle! 🚀".

sum_calculator.py	Sums numbers from 1 to N.

multiplecation_table.py	Generates a multiplication table from 1 to 9 using nested loops.

number_check.py	Validates user input; prevents crashes if letters are entered.

guessing_game.py	Random number guessing game with “higher/lower” hints.

midterm_counter.py	Calculates the time left until the user’s next exam using datetime.
